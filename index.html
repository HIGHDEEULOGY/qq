<h1>ITUNU MI</h1>
 
<h1>Hmmmm!!!!... My Journey in LASU would have been so lonely and boring without you in it, baby. It was not an accident that you came to me the very first day I set my eyes on you. The truth is that you found me first.<br><br>
I have been thinking of what to write to you, what to express and ofcourse there are so many words of expression I can get online, unfortunately I don't find any of them intriguing. Do you know why?, reason is because those words are not mine but someone else's feelings of expression. So I looked critically and deeply inside of me and just try to express my feelings through this piece.
<br><br>
Baby, If there are other words to express my feelings and love to you, I wouldn't mind or hesitate to use it right now. Every Morning when I wake up, naturally your though is what comes to my mind and I wouldnt mind getting to see you again even if its currently not convienient for both of us.
<br><br>
Despite our differences in opinnion, ways of thinking and in characteristics, my heart flutter whenever I think of you, this is love and it's no doubt that I'm deeply in love with you baby.<br><br>

Speaking of your personality; you are such an intelligent gentlelady; a loving and a young beautiful damsel; beautiful beyond man's imagination; your beauty is like a radiant that blaze every cloud, the fragrance that comes from you is like a cool bliss, your smile like the morning sun that shineth with a contrasting and appealing outlook, your body-shape is a killer-bean. Sincerely, I find it difficult to stop thinking about you baby. If only you can see through to my heart will you understand how I am feeling right now<br><br>

To you, maybe I don't care probably because I dont call often the way you want,but I dont want you to view it that way. Have this mindset that I am here longing to see you everyday, I am waiting to see you again. I want to cherish you, I want to hug you, I want to cherish your body and soul, I want to give you a deep kiss that no guy has and will ever give you, I want to cuddle you ad embrace you into my arms, I want to feel your love in my life.<br><br>

I wish you are thinking the same way i am thinking, I hope you also are thinking of me?. 
<br><br>

If by now you are not thinking about me, hmmm.. you are making a big mistake. Do not even think of scaring me away with your attitude.<br><br>

If it is God's will, I want to spend every bit of my life with you by my side. Do not even think of saying no.<br><br>

I hope we will get alone this new year, I hope my love in your heart will wax more stronger. Do not even think of another guy over me.<br><br>

To the love of my life, to the only one that have captured my heart, to the one i truly cherish. I love you dearly baby.<br><br><br>

Your Loving Boyfriend,<br>
